abstract: >
  TIE–Dialog is an open-source tool for dynamic, turn-by-turn analysis of conversational coherence.
  It models coherence as a time-indexed signal and detects emergent thresholds, rupture–repair events,
  and participant-level trajectories, supporting reproducible exploratory analysis and reporting.
